abstract = {This paper compares two data interchange formats currently used by industry applications; XML and JSON. The choice of an adequate data interchange format can have significant consequences on data transmission rates and performance. We describe the language specifications and their respective setting of use. A case study is then conducted to compare the resource utilization and the relative performance of applications that use the interchange formats. We find that JSON is significantly faster than XML and we further record other resource-related metrics in our results.},

@article{SPA,
abstract = {Single Page Application (SPA) is composed of individual component that can be replaced or updated independently, without refreshing whole page so that the entire page does not need to be reloaded on each user action, which saves bandwidth as well as no loading of external files every time when page is loaded, such as images or CSS files, etc. The purpose behind this is to make the subsequent page loads very fast as compared to traditional Request-Response cycle. SPA's written by using JavaScript, HTML5, AJAX are getting the likes of developers to build their web applications and some frameworks like AngularJS which are built on top of the JavaScript are making the life of developers very easy. The idea behind using AngularJS in web application is to make your web application modular and easy to maintain. AngularJS brings MVC (Model View Controller) capability to your application. After using minified and compressed files in your application, the size reduces to some KBs which will results in faster loading of pages.},

In this paper, we report the development of an authoring technology on top of a fully-implemented Interactive Storytelling system. Although this system originated as a debugging tool for a Planning system, its interactivity as well as the high-level nature of the formalism it manipulates makes it a candidate to support collaboration between authors and technologists.},

@article{FoundationsJSONSchema,
abstract = {JSON – the most popular data format for sending API re-quests and responses – is still lacking a standardized schema or meta-data definition that allows the developers to spec-ify the structure of JSON documents. JSON Schema is an attempt to provide a general purpose schema language for JSON, but it is still work in progress, and the formal spec-ification has not yet been agreed upon. Why this could be a problem becomes evident when examining the behaviour of numerous tools for validating JSON documents against this initial schema proposal: although they agree on most general cases, when presented with the greyer areas of the specification they tend to di↵er significantly. In this paper we provide the first formal definition of syntax and seman-tics for JSON Schema and use it to show that implementing this layer on top of JSON is feasible in practice. This is done both by analysing the theoretical aspects of the validation problem and by showing how to set up and validate a JSON Schema for Wikidata, the central storage for Wikimedia.},

@book{Aho1983,
abstract = {This book presents the data structures and algorithms that underpin much of today's computer programming. The basis of this book is the material contained in the first six chapters of our earlier work, The Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms. We have expanded that coverage and have added material on algorithms for external storage and memory management. As a consequence, this book should be suitable as a text for a first course on data structures and algorithms. The only prerequisite we assume is familiarity with some high-level programming language such as Pascal. We have attempted to cover data structures and algorithms in the broader context of solving problems using computers. We use abstract data types informally in the description and implementation of algorithms. Although abstract data types are only starting to appear in widely available programming languages, we feel they are a useful tool in designing programs, no matter what the language. We also introduce the ideas of step counting and time complexity as an integral part of the problem solving process. This decision reflects our longheld belief that programmers are going to continue to tackle problems of progressively larger size as machines get faster, and that consequently the time complexity of algorithms will become of even greater importance, rather than of less importance, as new generations of hardware become available.},

@techreport{Ray2014,
abstract = {What is the effect of programming languages on software qual-ity? This question has been a topic of much debate for a very long time. In this study, we gather a very large data set from GitHub (729 projects, 80 Million SLOC, 29,000 authors, 1.5 million com-mits, in 17 languages) in an attempt to shed some empirical light on this question. This reasonably large sample size allows us to use a mixed-methods approach, combining multiple regression model-ing with visualization and text analytics, to study the effect of lan-guage features such as static v.s. dynamic typing, strong v.s. weak typing on software quality. By triangulating findings from differ-ent methods, and controlling for confounding effects such as team size, project size, and project history, we report that language de-sign does have a significant, but modest effect on software quality. Most notably, it does appear that strong typing is modestly better than weak typing, and among functional languages, static typing is also somewhat better than dynamic typing. We also find that func-tional languages are somewhat better than procedural languages. It is worth noting that these modest effects arising from language de-sign are overwhelmingly dominated by the process factors such as project size, team size, and commit size. However, we hasten to caution the reader that even these modest effects might quite possi-bly be due to other, intangible process factors, e.g., the preference of certain personality types for functional, static and strongly typed languages.},

We systematically study extensions to tradi-tionally BT representations, which decouple the monitoring of user input, the narrative, and how the user may influ-ence the story outcome – referred to as Interactive Behavior Trees (IBT's). By quantitatively evaluating the authoring complexity of BT formalisms with traditional story graph representations, we show that IBT's better scale with the number of story arcs, and the degree and granularity of user input. Our theoretical estimate of authoring complexity is corroborated with a qualitative user study, which confirms that subjects take lesser time with reduced effort to author narratives using IBT's.

abstract = {JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a popular format for data serialization. Programmers use it extensively to encode data for transfer between a server and an Ajax application, to connect two servers communicating via Web services, and in many other similar scenarios. Yahoo's Douglas Crockford is JSON's self-appointed evangelist. He's also involved in the JavaScript community, author of JavaScript: The Good Parts (Yahoo Press, 2008), and developer of JSLint, a tool that aims to improve the quality of JavaScript applications. Crockford is careful to point out that he didn't invent JSON—rather, he simply discovered it, and told us all about his discovery when I recently spoke with him about JSON, XML, and the future. You can watch the video interview associated with this article at www.computer.org/ computingconversations.},

@article{GalyeanIII1995,
abstract = {Making narrative interactive promises to add a new depth and richness to the act of storytelling. It will allow us to experience story at a new level, more profoundly affecting us than ever before. But to do this we need to understand how a viewer can participate in a drama in interesting and engaging ways without disrupting the plot -- which is the essential structure that transforms a mere sequence of events into a story. This thesis describes an approach to interactive narrative that-divides narrative into levels; the plot level which represents the high level goals, intentions, and events of the story, and the presentation level representing the geometry, motion and camera which produces the images seen by the viewer. Today's immersive interface technology provides a seamless and compelling link between the viewer and the presentation level. But the link between the plot level and the presentation level remains unexplored. This document describes techniques as well as a theory for seamless integration of transitions (the plot's influence on the camera) and the manipulation of staging (the plot's influence on the geometry and motion) into interactive, immersive narratives. By introducing these techniques while allowing the viewer to influence the presentation, a new method and vocabulary for storytelling has been created. This new partnership between the story and the viewer allows the presentation to be manipulated while the plot assures that story will find the viewer regardless of his/her actions.},
