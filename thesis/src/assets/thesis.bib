@article{FoundationsJSONSchema,
abstract = {JSON – the most popular data format for sending API re-quests and responses – is still lacking a standardized schema or meta-data definition that allows the developers to spec-ify the structure of JSON documents. JSON Schema is an attempt to provide a general purpose schema language for JSON, but it is still work in progress, and the formal spec-ification has not yet been agreed upon. Why this could be a problem becomes evident when examining the behaviour of numerous tools for validating JSON documents against this initial schema proposal: although they agree on most general cases, when presented with the greyer areas of the specification they tend to di↵er significantly. In this paper we provide the first formal definition of syntax and seman-tics for JSON Schema and use it to show that implementing this layer on top of JSON is feasible in practice. This is done both by analysing the theoretical aspects of the validation problem and by showing how to set up and validate a JSON Schema for Wikidata, the central storage for Wikimedia.},

@inproceedings{Nurseitov,
abstract = {This paper compares two data interchange formats currently used by industry applications; XML and JSON. The choice of an adequate data interchange format can have significant consequences on data transmission rates and performance. We describe the language specifications and their respective setting of use. A case study is then conducted to compare the resource utilization and the relative performance of applications that use the interchange formats. We find that JSON is significantly faster than XML and we further record other resource-related metrics in our results.},

@article{Severance2012,
abstract = {JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a popular format for data serialization. Programmers use it extensively to encode data for transfer between a server and an Ajax application, to connect two servers communicating via Web services, and in many other similar scenarios. Yahoo's Douglas Crockford is JSON's self-appointed evangelist. He's also involved in the JavaScript community, author of JavaScript: The Good Parts (Yahoo Press, 2008), and developer of JSLint, a tool that aims to improve the quality of JavaScript applications. Crockford is careful to point out that he didn't invent JSON—rather, he simply discovered it, and told us all about his discovery when I recently spoke with him about JSON, XML, and the future. You can watch the video interview associated with this article at www.computer.org/ computingconversations.},

@book{Aho1983,
abstract = {This book presents the data structures and algorithms that underpin much of today's computer programming. The basis of this book is the material contained in the first six chapters of our earlier work, The Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms. We have expanded that coverage and have added material on algorithms for external storage and memory management. As a consequence, this book should be suitable as a text for a first course on data structures and algorithms. The only prerequisite we assume is familiarity with some high-level programming language such as Pascal. We have attempted to cover data structures and algorithms in the broader context of solving problems using computers. We use abstract data types informally in the description and implementation of algorithms. Although abstract data types are only starting to appear in widely available programming languages, we feel they are a useful tool in designing programs, no matter what the language. We also introduce the ideas of step counting and time complexity as an integral part of the problem solving process. This decision reflects our longheld belief that programmers are going to continue to tackle problems of progressively larger size as machines get faster, and that consequently the time complexity of algorithms will become of even greater importance, rather than of less importance, as new generations of hardware become available.},
